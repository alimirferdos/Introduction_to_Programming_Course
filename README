# Introduction to Computer Programming Course

This repository includes some of the solutions to assignments of a course I took in 2016 named "Introduction to computer programming" in C++.

I will list the solutions and give a brief description about them in this README file:

## 2D Rotation
Rotating a vector point with $(x,y)$ coordinates by $\theta$ degrees. The formula for such a rotation is:
$$\begin{bmatrix}x' \\ y'\end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix}cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta) \\ sin(\theta) &  cos(\theta)\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x \\ y\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}cos(\theta)*x-sin(\theta)*y \\ sin(\theta)*x+cos(\theta)*y\end{bmatrix}$$

*Note:* the above formula works for radian theta and we have to convert it from degrees to radians.

## Finding the angle between two given vertices 
We want to find the angle between two given vertices $(x1,y1)$ and $(x2,y2)$. 

There are several solutions to this problem but in this implementation, I've used the following:
$$\theta=|\theta_1-\theta_2| = |arctan(v_1)-arctan(v_2)|$$ 

## Solving $a^x = b$ for x
The solution can be given by the following formula:
$$x = log(a^x , a) = log(b , a) = \frac{log(b , 2)} {log(a , 2)}$$

## Points' Colors
A number of points in a 2D space are given: $(x,y,color)$.

We want to get the colors of the minimum and maximum points in terms of distance from origin.

## Finding the Error between $e^x$ and its Taylor Series
This implementation inputs x, k and will output $|e^x-taylor(i)|$ from $i = 0$ to $i = k$.

## Simple Text Processing: Word Counting
A string of words are given. We want to count the number of unique words in it.
